            string bookTitle = "Introduction to C#";
            string dueDate = "2024-12-01";

            // Requirements:
            // - Create a Book class with properties for the title and due date.
            // - Implement a DisplayBookInfo method in the Book class to show book details.
            // - Add a CheckDueDate method to verify if a book is overdue.
